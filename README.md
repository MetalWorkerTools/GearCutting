## Making (helical) gear cutters and gears using the button method.
A video, 3D design and excel calculation sheet for making (helical) gear cutters and gears on the mill and on the lathe using the button method.
### Video:
A [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ImloYwHc-BY) that shows how to make (helical) gear cutters and gears on the mill and on the lathe.
### Calculations:
In the [calculation](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/GearCutting) folder there is an excel sheet for the calculations.
### 3D design:
In the [3D design](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/GearCutting/tree/main/3D%20design) folder there is the FreeCad CAD file. In this file you find the design of the fly cutter and end mill style cutter.
### 3D print:
In the [3D print](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/GearCutting/tree/main/3D%20print) folder is a stf file for printing a plate for testing gears.
